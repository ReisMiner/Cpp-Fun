# Cpp-Fun

Does some funni things :)

## How To Use?

- install mingw64 (http://mingw-w64.org/doku.php/download)
- add mingw64 bin folder to path so you can run the commands in the CMD
- download main.cpp
- run `g++ -o start.exe main.cpp` in CMD to build da exe :)
- ignore da errors. i used deprecated stuff thats why they show up
- run `start start.exe` in CMD or double click da file lol
- prenk ur friends with the exe :)

### how to use the new virus?

basically the same as the old one, just change the file name.

also you can configure it when you edit the 4 `#defines` at the start of the file

### Fixing compiler stuff

Sometimes compilers are weird. 
If that happens and you cannot run da exe enter this build command: `g++ -o start.exe main.cpp -static-libgcc -static-libstdc++`
