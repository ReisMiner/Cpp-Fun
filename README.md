# Cpp-Fun

Does some funni things :)

## How To Use?

- install mingw64
- make download main.cpp
- run `g++ -o start.exe main.cpp` in CMD to build da exe :)
- ignore da errors. i used deprecated stuff thats why they show up
- run `start start.exe` in CMD 
- prenk ur friends with the exe :)

### Fixing comiler stuff

Sometimes compilers are weird. 
If that happens and you cannot run da exe enter this build command: `g++ -o start.exe main.cpp -static-libgcc -static-libstdc++`
